{ ✨ Hello, I'm ST123_stsoham_Chess, the creator of some successful studies on lichess. Welcome to my study! ✨

[Edit: Thank you all for 400 likes!]

In this study, I'll share one of the best beginner-friendly weapons with White to CRUSH your opponents! The fun part? It is used even at the Master level! What opening could I possibly be talking about? It is the Vienna Game!

If you find this study helpful, please give it a heart 💓! It helps more players discover this study and adds it to the "favourites" list to help you find this study again easily.

If you have any questions about the study, please DM me or write it in the chatbox.

Let's get started! Play 1. e4. }
1. e4 e5 { Black responds with the most common move in the lichess database. 1. e4 openings like the Ruy Lopez, Italian Game, Petrov's Defense are known to be quite slow and boring.
But we don't want any of that, so we play 2. Nc3! A rare opening which takes your opponent out of the theory portion quite early on. } 2. Nc3 { This is the beginning of the Vienna Game. I've been playing the Vienna Game for a little over a year now, on chess.com, lichess & OTB tournaments, and with online stats of over 230 games, I have a whopping winrate of 60.5%!
Black has a variety of options here. Most people play Nf6 or Nc6, but you'll find some people playing Bc5 or Bb4 here and there.
Feel free to use the engine and the Lichess database, and don't forget to explore the variations!🕵

2... Nf6 { This is the most popular move at master level, because of the main line, but many of your opponents may not know the mainline and are just playing it because it looks like a reversed Italian! } 3. f4 { We strike in the center with f4. Black here has to know 3...d5, the mainline, but often they'll lead themselves into a passive position, sometimes even borderline losing! We'll expand on Black's options [exf4, Nc6 & d6] in the following chapters, marked with 📕.

3... exf4? { Taking the free pawn is a mistake, as it allows us to kick their knight with tempo while grabbing space. } 4. e5 { Black here has 3 options:
Ng8 which is the only option to not lose immediately;
Qe7 which loses the game; and
Nd5 which is tricky but is losing } 4... Ng8 $7 { This is the safest option for black. This is the only move that doesn't lose you on the spot! Here, we have a very straightforward plan: Nf3, d4, Bxf4, Bc4 and use the open f-file to create an attack. We'll look at this move in the next chapter. } (4... Nd5? { Even though it seems as if black loses a piece, it's not that easy after Qh4+. We'll look at this move along with 4...Qe7 in one of the following chapters. }) (4...

4... Ng8 5. Nf3! { This is necessary! We need to prevent Qh4+. In this position, our play will develop with d4-Bc4/Bb5-Qe2-Bxf4-O-O and we put a lot of pressure along the f-pawn. We will attack on the kingside. } { [%csl Bh4,Ge5][%cal Bf3h4,Rd8h4,Gf3e5] } 5... d6 (5... g5?! { Black can try to play this like a King's Gambit, but the key difference here is we have 2 knights developed and a pawn on e5, so this just further slows their development while throwing pawns that weakens the position! I think you get that this move is terrible. } 6. Bc4 { You can play d4 here, even computer agrees, but I like to play Bc4, purely in Muzio Gambit style. [1. e4 e4 2. f4 exf4 3. Nf3 g5 4. Bc4 g4 5.

They have no pieces developed, and we are ready to throw bombs like Bxf7 on the king, while his army stays sleeping in their bunker. }) 6. d4 dxe5 { Technically, we can continue solidly with Qe2-Bxf4, but we have a better option: Bb5+
This was enabled because it is actually inaccurate to play dxe5 before Nc6. } 7. Bb5+! c6 (7... Nc6 { They can develop, but this isn't good because at any time we can just take the knight and damage their pawn structure and simply go play an endgame where black has a crazy bad structure. } 8. Qe2! { But we can also play this move, which is engine's top recommendation btw. There's a crazy sequence here that gives us a slight advantage which I'm including but basically we don't need to remember all of that, just remember that we will take the f4 pawn (taking advantage of the pin) and long castle, or take the e5 pawn if given the chance. } 8...

You cannot play any other move because it just doesn't work, Bg5+ gets blocked by Nf6, Qxd8+ fails as we are down a piece and we cannot simplify, we need to justify the sacrifice! } (10... Kxf7 11. Qxd8 { Free Queen! }) 11. Qe2+! Kxf7 12. Ne5+! { This is also a forced move, we cannot allow the black king to g6. But, we put black in a really sticky situation. Moving back to the e-file (Ke8, Ke7 or Ke6) will lead to Nc6+, winning the queen. So surely Kf6 will save black, right? } { [%csl Bc6][%cal Rf7e6,Rf7e7,Rf7e8,Be5c6,Ye2e8] } 12... Kf6 (12... Ke8 13.

Firstly, this is forced mate! But I don't want to bother you with a mate in 21 💀 Instead, the simple idea is, if black takes the bishop, Nxf7+ will win the black queen. But if black moves away from the check, we take the queen by our bishop! } 13... Kxg5 14. Nf7+ { [%cal Bf7g5,Bf7d8] } *

✨ Remember guys, never put your pieces where they can easily be attacked by other enemy pieces. ✨ } (4... Nd5? { Although we know this is a tricky try, it is actually really easy to counter } 5.

Ng8 { Again, we must play Nf3 following basic principles. Although Mr. Fish recommends d4, it is purely due to the fact that we have so much development that we can afford to play the stunning Kd1 if Qh4+ happens. But I don't quite understand the need to lose the right to castle, so I recommend (and play) the easier Nf3.
Now the plan here is to play Nf3, d4, Bxf4, O-O-O and later Qf2-Bc4 can be a motive to develop the LSB. } 6. Nf3 { But, we don't have to play out the entire middlegame if Black plays d6, whether be before Nc6 or after Nc6. The plan remains the same. } 6... d6?? 7. Nd5! { Black has to move the queen somewhere, but wherever it moves we <FORCEFULLY> win material. } { [%csl Bc7,Ye7][%cal Bd5c7,Yd5e7] } 7... Qd7 (7...

If any minor piece blocks, we play Nxc7+ Kd8 dxe7+ and follow with Nxa8. } { [%cal Bd5c7,Yd6c7] } *

Want to know something even more cool? We have a straight forward plan against it and we have great attacking chances in this variation.

3... Bc5?! 4. Qg4! { We target the pawn black leaves behind! Unless black knows what they're doing, it's very difficult for them to find the best moves in this position. There are numerous ways to blunder, most of them are seemingly natural moves. Just for reference, Kf8! is the top engine move! The plans in Kf8 & g6 are the same, hence I won't cover Kf8 individually. } { [%cal Bg4g7] } 4... g6 (4... Qf6 { This is the fun variation. This will happen more at lower levels, but you can also catch someone off guard at higher levels.

We can also play Rf1. } { [%csl Bf7,Rc7,Bf1,Bf3][%cal Rd5c7,Bh1f1,Bf1f7] }) 5.

Nge2 { The problem with g6 is that it creates dark-squared weaknesses in the kingside which are easy for us to exploit. I wouldn't even be surprised if Bf8 is played at higher levels, they need to defend the dark squares. But firstly, we need to defend our weaknesses! The d4 square is really weak, and black could exploit it with Nd4! forcing Qd1 otherwise Nxc2+, we need to play Nge2 controlling Nd4 before d3. } 6... d6 7. d3 Bg4 8. Qg3 { If Bxe2 Nxe2, still keeping control of the d4 square. We're now threatening to play Bg5-Qh4-Nd5, winning the knight.

3. f4 d6 (3... exf4?! { Although computer only deviates by 0.3, exf4 is a massive commitment of the position. Black basically gives us the center in its entirety AND wants to get punched while doing that. We'll play Nf3 first, to avoid any Qh4+, and then we'll play d4-Bxc4 and castling is flexible, we can castle long or short, depending on your interests. } 4. Nf3 d6 (4... Nc6 5. Bc4 { d4 immediately here is a little dangerous, we'll follow our original setup with Bc4-d3-Bxf4, as d4 Nxd4 Nxd4 Qh4+ is risky. }) 5. d4 Bb6 6.

Bb5! { Now there's no risk of Nxd4, so we've essentially enabled d4. } 6... Bd7 7. d4 { Now Nxd4 will be followed by Bxd7+, Black cannot respond with Qxd7 as then Qh4+ would no longer be a possibility, allowing Nxd4. Kxd7 would be awkward for Black to play, but also then we can play Nxc5+ dxc5 c3, winning the piece. }) 6. Nxb6 axb6 7. Bb5 { We've seen this idea earlier, we want to damage the black pawn structure as well as we're suddenly threatening to win the e5 pawn. } 7... Bd7 8. d3 { This is black's last chance to take our f4 pawn, we won't wait any longer. If our DSB is the last piece remaining to develop and black hasn't made a decision with the tension in the center, we'll almost always go with f5 attack kingside. } 8... Nge7 9. f5 O-O 10.

Bxd5 c6 10. Bb3 a5 11. Nxd4 Bxd4 12. a4 { This is a complicated position, our plan should be to play Qf3. Our queen can then go to g3, where we'll threaten many threats like Bg5-Bf6, or Bg5-f6, and also Bh6. }) 7. Na4 { We again grab the bishop pair. We could also do this in 2...Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 lines where Bg4 pins happen, but there I've included a more dynamic option which I think would be more fun. But against this, as black doesn't really threaten to put any pressure with Nd4 (no knight on c6) we go for the bishop pair. } 7... Bb6 8. Nxb6 axb6 9. O-O { Our plan will be to play h3, forcing Bxf3, if Bh5 then g4-f5 traps the bishop. Don't be afraid to push the pawns, we have plenty of attackers on the KS that can become defenders if needed. Bxf3 Qxf3 and our plan will be to play f5-Bg5 and Qh3-Qh4-Rf3-Rh3 is a potential idea. } *
