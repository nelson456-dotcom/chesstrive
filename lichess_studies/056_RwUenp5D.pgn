{ Bonus

When a pawn on b7 (instead of a bishop) is defending a knight, our tactic can still be highly effective. Although the pattern is slightly different, the same idea applies. Consider the following example:

Ne5 Rc8 10. Nxc6 Rxc6? 11. Bxa6! { And there we have our deflection tactic again! This time, the pawn is the defender of a rook instead of a knight. An important point here is that the pinned rook is a poor defender, making 11...Rxa6 impossible.

White threatens to capture on b7, while after taking on a6, the knight on c6 is unprotected, leading to the destruction of the pawn structure on the queenside.

{ Pattern 46 - Deflecting the king’s bishop

Sliding the bishop to the edge of the board to lure an enemy fianchettoed bishop away from defending a knight can also occur on the other side of the board on squares h6/h3. We now focus on deflecting the king’s bishop with the idea that afterwards, the unprotected knight can be captured with a knight fork on the queen and king.

piece. })) 2. Nxf6+ Bxf6 3. Bxf8 Rxf8 { And White went on to capitalize on his material advantage and secured victory.
In the last game, Black found himself unable to prevent material loss in response to the deflection tactic. Let’s go back to that game and see how Black could have defended against this tactic if White had attempted it one move earlier: } *

{ Pattern 47 - Exploiting the f3/f6-square

Just like in Pattern 46, in this Pattern the f3/f6-square plays an important role. Once again, we aim to put a knight on this square, this time not to fork, but in preparation for the checkmate that follows on the next move.

To achieve this, we must first eliminate the bishop, the defender of the f3/f6-square.

We start with an example from the Scotch Opening:

Nd5! { White ignores the twofold attack on the d4-knight and threatens to remove the defender of the pinned e7-knight with 8. Nxc6. Can’t Black now just take the knight on d4?
Note that a 2700+ grandmaster missed this chance and played 7.Nxc6 instead (Adams-Landa Playchess.com blitz 2006), which goes to show that the tactic played in the game is far from obvious. } 7... Bxd4 (7... Nxd4 8. Bxe7) (7... f6 8. Nxf6+) 8. Qxd4! { The second point of 7.Nd5, White eliminates the defender of square f6!

{ Pattern 48 - The Smith-Morra Gambit trick

Like in Pattern 47, we again focus on eliminating a defender to deliver checkmate. This time, we lure away a knight that defends the h2/h7 mating square. In the Smith-Morra Gambit of the Sicilian Defence, this idea is a well-known trap.

{ Pattern 49 - Exchanging queens for a double threat

It is not always necessary to sacrifice material to eliminate a defender. In this Pattern, we will aim for an exchange of queens to bring about a double threat in the position. This idea can arise in various lines of the Scotch Opening.
