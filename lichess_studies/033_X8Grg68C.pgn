{ Welcome to the Nc3 e3 Atomic Opening Study!

Please leave a heart as it would mean a lot to my hard work.

This is an uncommon opening with many traps and simple ideas, that will be sure to catch even the strongest players off guard!

Whether you're here to just take a look, or to really dive in depth, you will be sure to learn something.

I highly recommend looking at the analysis board after you complete a chapter to see the sidelines if you really want to learn this in depth. } { [%cal Gb1c3] }
1. Nc3!! { This is the starting move of the uncommon but powerful Nc3 e3 setup.
It is sure to give you an interesting game, unless your opponent falls into one of the common traps :)
I was able to obtain the ATCM title (2000) in just about a month by spamming this opening, so if you're serious you should be able to do the same. } { [%cal Rc7c6,Re7e6,Rg8f6,Re7e5,Rd7d5,Ge2e3] } (1. Nf3 { Why'd you even come here if you didn't want to learn the best opening???
Play Nc3 for starting setup :) }) *

You can then often play an in-between move of Nf3 once your queen gets attacked, as it threatens mate. Follow up with your bishop, and you have an easy, intuitive, and powerful attack. } *
