Let's start! Play 1. e4! 🚀 }
1. e4 { "Best by test" as Bobby Fisher says. } 1... e5 { Play 2. Nf3 :) } { [%csl Gf3][%cal Gg1f3] } 2. Nf3 d6 { Ok, welcome to the Philidor Defense! It is actually quite a popular opening for Black, the second most played move after 2...Nc6. It's known for being a solid choice for Black, already creating a solid pawn chain. Personally, I have found this opening very annoying to face, and that is why this study was created.
So, I'm gonna show you how to PUNISH it! :D
The study is divided into 3 sections. Remember that when you're done with the study and revisit it in the future, you can look for your desired move by typing it in the magnifying glass next to the a8 square.
Feel free to use the engine and the Lichess database, and don't forget to explore the variations! 🕵

There’s a lot packed into this study, so don’t worry about memorizing everything. Focus on understanding the key ideas instead. It’s nearly impossible to remember every single line, but I’ve given you almost everything you need. Take what you can, and trust that the ideas will guide you in your games.
LSB = Light-Squared-Bishop
DSB = Dark-Squared-Bishop
P.S. My lines will not always be the absolute top engine move, they are rather based on which one is more comfortable to play as a human and have a decent winrate.
P.P.S. The OGs might remember I made a study on this 2–3 years ago. Yes, you're absolutely right! It didn’t get popular back then (bad timing and all), but this is a better version that’ll hopefully reach more people. 🙂

{ Welcome to section 1! Let's first introduce you to the gambit we'll play. Follow the arrows! } { [%csl Gd4][%cal Gd2d4] }
3. d4! { Immediately we are threatening to take e5. } { [%cal Rd4e5] } 3... exd4 { Black takes on d4, breaking down the central tension. This is most popular and the mainline.
Now we are going to hit black with a much more rarer move which is only being played 3% of the time.
Play 4. c3! } { [%cal Gc2c3] } 4. c3! { This is the beginning of the Bird Gambit! (Not actually named after Henry Bird, by the way.) We gambit a pawn but in return will get a ton of development and initiative.
"Hey, this isn't Stockfish's top move!" Yes, that's true, but as I've mentioned in the intro, we are going for FUN + AGGRESSIVE, and this opening absolutely delivers! It's kinda has the Danish, Goring Gambit vibes. } 4... dxc3 { Again, most popular, and actually leads to the most fun stuff.
We'll be looking at this move in the following chapters. We'll respond with... } { [%csl Gc4][%cal Gf1c4] } 5. Bc4! { Has white gone mad, sacrificing a second pawn!? Yes, we are, but in return, we're get HUGE compensation for it, and this is the move I’m recommending. Of course, White could have just recaptured the the pawn with the knight and white would also get some compensation for it, but 5. Bc4! will lead to way more active and tactical positions. With Bc4 we are aiming at the vulnerable f7 pawn and we are able to castle anytime we want.
Btw, this position is also reachable directly with the Danish Gambit: 1. e4 e5 2. d4 exd4 3. c3 dxc3 4. Bc4 d6 5. Nf3
Our winrate is at 58%. The eval is -0.2, so really nothing dubious. I fully recommend you play this OTB.

1. The king is ready to castle
2. The two bishops are dominating the a1-h8 and a2-g8 diagonals
3. The queen can come join the attack very easily
Advantages for Black:
1. Has 2 extra pawns
White is almost fully developed and it's still move 6, meanwhile every single piece from black is on the 8th rank.
With perfect play it's 100% equal, but for humans, I think white's going to have lots of fun :) } { [%csl Gf3,Gc4,Gb2,Bg1,Ra8,Rb8,Rc8,Rd8,Re8,Rg8,Rf8,Rh8,Bd5,Bb3][%cal Rb2a1,Rb2h8,Be1g1,Yc4a2,Yc4g8,Bd1d5,Bd1b3] } 6...

Qb3! { Forking both pawns. Black's best option is to accept the fact that they're gonna lose a pawn and develop with Nc6 or another developing move. Just a reminder. The position is still 100% equal, but White has a whopping 64% winrate. } { [%csl Re6,Rb7] } 8... Qc8?? { By far the most popular, but a losing blunder. Black got too greedy here. } (8... Nc6! { Instead of taking one of the pawns (and getting chased away) we can bring the king to safety. } 9. O-O! Qc8 { Never too late to get greedy. Black decides he wants to defend the pawns anyway. } (9... Qd7! { Your opponent is very high level. Do not take b7, Black will skewer the queen and bishop. } 10. Nbd2 { Instead we prioritize finishing development. We have a very comfortable (yet, according to the computer, equal) position. White's winrate is at 56%. o-o-o, is a dubious move here, because we've got the open b and c files to attack the king. if Nf6, follow up with Ng5 - e5 breaking the center and get the rooks on the d file. } { [%csl Gd2,Gf3,Gb2,Gb3][%cal Ba1b1,Bb1d1] }) 10.

You don't want to trade the knight for the passive DSB tho, the knights worth much more. Also, Nxe4 leads to Re1 which is absolutely crushing. } { [%csl Gg1,Re8,Ge6,Gb3,Gb2][%cal Be6c7,Be6d8,Be6f8,Be6g7,Be6g5,Be6f4,Be6c5,Be6d4] }) (9... e5?? { Also too late, should have been played a move earlier. } 10.

Qxe6 { Now the queen has left her b pawn hanging. } 11. Qxb7 { The rook is trapped. } { [%csl Ra8] } 11... Nc6! { It's very important that this is covered. A very nice trap from black. DO NOT TAKE THE ROOK! Black will get enough counterplay after Qxe4. If Black plays anything else besides Nc6, just take a8 and be happy with your great position and material advantage. } 12. Qxc6!

From here develop normally. Make sure not to trade queens and play aggressively. } { [%csl Re7,Re8,Rf8,Rd7,Rc8][%cal Bb1c3,Ba1d1] }) 9. Nc3 $16 { Here you get a very good game with a 75% winrate.

I urge you not to attempt to actually memorize all these, but I'm giving you some ideas, if familiarized with a bit, will help you play this opening very successfully. As, many transpositions will lead to this position. But feel free to move on to the next chapter if you want. } 9... g6?? { This is a common attempt to try to bring the king to a safer place, white can just execute the same idea, which is hopping the knight to d5 and try to break open the center. This is a blunder because it opens the diagonal for our DSB to shine! } (9...

3... f5!? { This is the Philidor Countergambit, if you don't know how to play against it it can be quite tricky. Most people will probably take either f5/e5 but these moves lead to lots of traps for Black. White must play very carefully to retain the advantage. @BunnyMommyIsHappy, a member of our team, actually made a study on this variation from Blacks' perspective: https://lichess.org/study/UeByH3ZL A big problem now for Black is that the king is weakened. We can take advantage of the weak light squares with the move... } { [%csl Rf7] } 4. Bc4! { Played only 3% of the time! Not covered by @BunnyMommyIsHappy.
