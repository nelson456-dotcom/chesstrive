{ There are good reasons why off-beat opening lines are rarely seen. In September GOTM we get to see some of the underlying facts that so-called Levitsky Attack is seldom played, of course with imaginative attacking display. Enjoy! }
1. d4 { [%clk 0:03:00] } 1... d5 { [%clk 0:03:00] } 2. Bg5 { This move, which is known to be somewhat dubious, has some logic behind it. White might aim for "Torre Attack" or "London" type of development scheme with e3, Nf3, Bd3 and so on, sometimes transposing into QGD with c4 or White can aim for non-theoretical fight creating an imbalanced position from the very beggining.
The move 2.Bg5 was also tried by the author of these words. Quite surprisingly it worked well in practice for me, mainly due to the early bishop move is a rare guest in tournament practice. } { [%clk 0:02:59] } 2... f6 { This ambitious move preparing ...e5 with tempo shares first place with 2...c5 on Stockfish's preference list at a respectable depth by a very small margin. } { [%clk 0:02:59] } (2... c5 { Second top choice of our beloved friend, Stockfish. } 3. dxc5 { Planning to play c2-c4 or e2-e4. } 3...

Nh6 { This is the usual follow-up to play Nf5 asking further questions to white's dark squared bishop. } { [%clk 0:02:59] } 4. f3 { Logical reaction, but this move makes it harder for White to develop. If White manages to play e4 then everything will be fine... } { [%clk 0:02:58] } (4. e3 Nf5 5.
