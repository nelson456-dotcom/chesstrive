🚀Hello and welcome back to another study by Chessmate!🌲Long time no see!😉

First, some good old questions.
🤔Want an opening that boosts your win rate?🚀
🤔Want an opening that eviscerate e5?🔥
🤔Want an opening that even an IM suggests?✨

Well, this is the ultimate opening repertoire for you!🤗I introduce...🥁🥁🥁

The Vienna Gambit!🎶🎻So, what is the Vienna Gambit?🤔Is there really an IM suggest this?

My answer is, yes! The IM is your favourite🥰chess youtuber GothamChess aka. IM Levy Rozman!👦🏻

Okay now start back to the point, the Vienna🎶🎻is the poisoned opening🍷that remarkably wins you a TON of games. How?🤔

By gambiting Freddie, we can PUSH Eddie forward and attack the horse🐴then beat it up to earn meat🍖and add pepper and lemonade🍋in it... Oh wait, wrong one.😅

Play 1. e4 and let's dive in!🚀 Wait don't dive🤿into the sea!🌊 }
1. e4!! { Wow e4! Yeah I know e4 is great you don't need to be like wow okay?😅Anyways, I will NOT explain this so... Music!🎶🎻
Okay fine not funny.🤐 } 1... e5 { Woah e5! Yeah I know e5 is cool.😎But you don't have to be like Woah. To prevent you being in a science lab or what🧪we will NOT play Nf3 but instead go for Nc3!😉
Oh and, if you wanna know why I'm not publishing studies in the meantime, play the Bongcloud.⛅ } { [%csl Bc3][%cal Bb1c3] } 2. Nc3!! { Wait, what does this move even do? It looks useless right? Why are we protecting our pawn when it’s not even attacked?
Are we crazy🤪or just dumb? No, no, this has a hidden gambit behind it! Tricks at every corner, and traps!
JAM💥that "Next Chapter"▶button and let's start!🎶🎻
Oh and if you want a repertoire of 2...Nf6, be sure to leave a like!💕Reach 250💕and a PART 2 WILL COME SOON!😉
🎯Psst, practice the Vienna Gambit in games and get this full repertoire for free💸in Noctie: https://go.noctie.ai/vienna_gambit 🦉 } (2. Ke2 { So yeah, you are wondering why I recently been gone👻from study creating in the past month.
So so sorry😣for that, I've been struggling with my very important exam📜lately, so... there you are! The reason!
Don't ask me how the results are tho.😶Trust me, it'd be good cause I have good grades before.📑
Oh and, for a further warning ⚠ , the next study📚will be out in the next two weeks or more.🙃 }) *
