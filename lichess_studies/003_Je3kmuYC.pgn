{ Play e4 to begin! (Best by test!) }

Now here comes the crazy 🤯 part. How can we prepare d4 so we can recapture with a pawn? } { [%csl Rd4][%cal Rd2d4] } 3. c3 { Awesome! We are going to take the whole center! Here, black can play Nf6, Bc5? d6?!, and d5! and they are the most common moves. Don't forget to press the heart button below! } (3. d4 { How can we prepare this move? }) *
