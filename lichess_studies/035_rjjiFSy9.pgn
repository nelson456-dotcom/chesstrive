1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5 Na5! { The Polerio Defense. Moves like these are why we can still play the Two Knights Defense. By keeping the pawn on d5, White is no longer able to play the Fried Liver Attack.
Black gives up a pawn for development. } 6. Bb5+ c6 7. dxc6 bxc6 { Capturing with a pawn instead of the knight? The idea is too keep attacking with TEMPO. } { [%cal Rc6b5] } 8. Be2 h6 { Attack! } 9.

White has lost some valuable time developing and may need to give back their center pawn to get back in the game. } { [%cal Gf8c5,Ge8g8,Gd8d6,Bf3e5,Bd2d4,Be1g1] } *
