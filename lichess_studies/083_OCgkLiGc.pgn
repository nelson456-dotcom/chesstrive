{ White is better:
Black has weak dark-squares, especially on the queenside, and isolated d-pawn.
White getting a knight to c3 and king to d4 would put Black almost in zugzwang.

However, White's h-pawn provides a hook for Black to gain counterplay. If it were on h2 all would be fine. }
1... g5! 2. hxg5 { White is forced to capture to avoid weakening his structure. } (2. Nc5 gxh4 3. gxh4) (2. h5 { This might also be considered. }) 2... fxg5 3. Nb4 (3. f4 gxf4 4. exf4 d4+!) *
