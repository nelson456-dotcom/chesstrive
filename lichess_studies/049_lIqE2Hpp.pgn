{ This game took place in round 2 of a strong FIDE Norm event in Riga, Latvia. Having come off of a win vs the Italian FM Nicolo Napoli in round 1, Naroditsky found himself face-to-face with the strong Russian IM Vassily Korchmar. Having already won an incredibly sharp encounter in his first game, Naroditsky would keep up the trend in round 2, putting the talented Russian IM to the sword. }
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. d3 b5 7. Bb3 d6 8. a3!? { This is the start of an interesting refinement. } (8. a4 { This is the more common move, when many games across history have continued: } 8...

Ba2 Be6 { gave Naroditsky a win vs. me in a blitz game a long time ago }) 10. Be3!? { An interesting decision. With this move, Naroditsky invites the continuation 10... Nd4, and with it, a potential change in the structure. } (10. h3!? { This was the alternative, although it does seem that black gets the better of it after: } 10... Bxf3 11. Qxf3 Nd4! { This is the nuance that players must understand when playing a2-a3 back on move 8. Now, black can mess up white's pawn structure following: } 12. Qd1 Nxb3 13. cxb3 c5! { With a solid grip on white's main breaks. White himself can continue in several ways, most notably: } 14. f4!? { This is the typical way white seeks counterplay in such structures. } (14. Bg5!? { It may makes sense to want to trade off the bishop for knight, as Bxf6 would give white a significant advantage with the good knight vs. the bad bishop. However, black has: } 14... Nxe4! { This is an important resource. } (14... Ne8!? $13 { That being said, black could have also just avoided the trade like this, meaning in some sense that deciding on whether to play the position with good knight vs. bad bishop is now somewhat irrelevant. }) 15. dxe4 Bxg5 16. Qd5?! (16. Qd3! { It feels far stronger to prepare doubling pieces while keeping the option of Nc3-d5 on the cards. } 16... b4 { Now this move can be met by: } 17. axb4 cxb4 18. Nd5! $10 { When white should have enough compensation for the sacrificed pawn in the form of a firmly placed knight, and sound pressure on black's weaknesses, including the d6, a6, and b4 pawns. }) 16... b4! { Immediately taking advantage of white's lapse in concentration. Without the knight being able to reach the d5-square, it will have very little purpose, as the game showed: } 17. Ne2 a5! 18. a4 Ra7!? $15 { Li, Ruifeng - Stukopin, A., 0-1, 23rd Space Coast Open, 2016, https://lichess.org/S57jStwv } { And black eventually managed to convert his extra pawn }) (14. b4!? { This was another move chosen by white in this position, when the continuation: } 14... h6! { This move makes the most sense to me. If we consider how difficult the positions were when white managed to create the favorable imbalance of good knight vs bad bishop, preventing this transformation is all the more natural. } 15. Qb3 Rc8 16. Be3 Qd7 17. Rfc1 $10 { And the positional grind continues } { Petrosyan, M. - Nogerbek, Kazybek, 1/2-1/2, World Rapid 2023, https://lichess.org/Ot3raFFx }) (14. Qf3!? { White prepares the move Bg5, as we know that the Nxe4 idea only works if it is able to attack white's queen on the next move with Nxc3. } 14... h6! { Again, this seems like the best practical choice. } (14... Qd7!? 15. Bg5! { White again aims for the imbalance, although this time black can play: } 15... Ne8! 16. Bxe7 Qxe7 17. Nd5 Qd8 $10 { Although white has indeed found a way to entrench its knight on the d5-square, here it is not as good as black's knight is also well-placed, as he might continue with Ne8-c7, and then to e6 afterwards. } { Nieuwland, A. Huib - Kinchant, Kevin D, 1/2-1/2, AUS/NZ-NED 2013, https://lichess.org/ri5Mpxqm }) 15.

Nd5 Nd7 { From here, the game changes character. As you will notice, the change of the structure has a tangible impact on the flow of events, as black has a definite space advantage on the queenside, and white has a space advantage on the other wing. } (12... Nxd5 { MI } 13. Bxd5 Rc8 { was Aronian's choice in some games }) 13. h3! { This makes the most sense to me, as white wants to get rid of the pin. } (13. Nxe7+!? { Interestingly enough, there was another high level master game that continued like this. To be honest, I wasn't so sure of this move at first as it seemed like white's knight on d5 was perfectly placed. } 13... Qxe7 14. h3 Bxf3 { This trade is forced as Bh5 ran into g4! } 15. Qxf3 Nc5 (15... Nb6!? $146 { This was another possibility, as black wants to be direct and continue with his queenside plan at once. } 16. Qg3 c5 17. f4 c4! 18. Ba2 Rac8 19. Qf2! { This shows the drawback of an immediate breakthrough. Without a pawn on e5 as support, the d-pawn lacks significant cover whenever black tries to execute his queenside plans. } 19... Qf6 20. g4!? { The new threat is g4-g5, but black can parry this with: } 20... h6! 21. h4 { continuing the threats, but after: } 21... Na4! 22. g5 Qe6! $132 { And now, capturing on d4 runs into Qg4+. These lines show just how difficult it is for both players to progress, even if at first glance they have clear advantages on one particular side of the board. }) 16. Bd5 Rac8 17. Bc6!? { This is a very interesting try to deny black the possibility of c7-c6. } 17... Nd7 18. Qg3 Ne5 19. Bd5 c6 20. Bb3! { The following sequence of events seemed to have favored white as now he continue with active measures on the kingside. } 20... Nd7 21. f4 c5 22. Qf2 Rfe8 23. Ba2!? $14 { Both sides have a nice space advantage on their respective wings, but it is hard to say for sure how either side will make tangible progress in the eye of the other sides' counterplay. }) 13... Bxf3 14. Qxf3 { MI - a decade ago I used Svidler's old Ruy Lopez course on Chess24 to understand these positions. The verdict back then was that Black could equalize with best play, but had to be accurate due to the long-term danger of White having the better bishop (as Botvinnik liked to say - you can often evaluate the position correctly by comparing the bishops. And that's all the more true in opposite-coloured bishop positions). } 14... c6 15. Nf4!? { Naroditsky avoids the trade. It makes if you consider how hard it was to make progress in the lines we just laid out, namely: } (15. Nxe7+!? Qxe7 16. Qg3 Nc5 17. Ba2 Na4 18. Rab1 c5! $10 { Hakobyan, Aram - Yoo, Christopher Woojin, 1/2-1/2, US Chess Masters 2021, https://lichess.org/G0t0IwsY } { And once again, it will not be easy for white to prove an advantage in the face of black's queenside counterplay. }) 15... Rb8 16. g4?! { Maybe not the best way to continue. } (16. Qg4 { MI }) (16. Qg3 { MI }) 16... a5 17. Ne2 a4 18. Ba2 Qb6 19. Qg2 b4 20. axb4 Qxb4 21. Rab1 Qc5 22. Ng3 Rfe8 23. f4 Rb4 24. g5 Reb8 25.

{ This game comes from a tournament filled with massive stakes- The 2020 US Chess Online Qualifier was an enormous event featuring some of the top players in the country. A victory in the event meant you could participate in the 2021 US Closed Championships in St. Louis. While playing under pressure might be a burden for some, Naroditsky thrived in the spotlight. This 35-move knockout was no exception. }

Nge2!? { As usual for Naroditsky, he takes a standard opening and throws a bit of a twist. White is perfectly fine after Nxc4, as he will argue that his central control and potential for kingside expansion will compensate for black's bishop pair. } (5.

{ This game took place in round 6 of a big open European event in Bulgaria in 2012. Facing a challenging field made up of a ton of highly ranked Grandmasters, Naroditsky was about to face his toughest test yet in the form of the strong Serbian GM Bojan Vuckovic (2628). Playing someone 150 points higher rated is always a tough challenge, but true to his fighting spirit, Danya faced it head-on. }

{ For our next game, we take a look at an all-time Naroditsky classic. His provocative, almost daring nature causes his opponent to step too far, and after white's slip-up, Danya shows no mercy. }
1. e4 g6!? { As I mentioned in the beginning, this is true to Naroditsky's style. Playing the modern is always risky, but knowing that he is playing a lower rated player, he does what he can to immediately create imbalance in the position, understanding that he will be able to outplay him in the chaos that ensues. } 2. d4 Bg7 3. Nf3 d6 4. Bc4!? { This is an interesting setup. } (4. Nc3!? { This was the main way in which white continues, to which black has a few setups he can adopt. } 4... Nf6 { This is the main way of continuing, which transposes into a Pirc. } (4... a6!? { This is another way black can continue, as was made popular by the Swedish GM Tiger Hillarp Persson. } 5. a4! { This is a principled way of continuing, as white looks to prevent the b7-b5 plan altogether. } 5... Nf6 6. Be2 O-O 7. O-O Nc6 8. h3! { Preventing black's idea of continuing with Bc8-g4. } 8... e5! { Fighting for space in the center. } 9. dxe5 dxe5 10. Bc4! { With the b5-square, bringing the bishop to this square makes a lot of sense. Now, once again, we have a bit of a split-off: } 10... Be6!? { This is a very combative way of dealing with white's pressure, hoping to get dynamic compensation in the form of the open f-file for the fractured pawn structure. } (10... Qe7!? { Delaying the bishop transfer can be rather dangerous } 11. Nd5! { And white has good play, say after: } 11... Nxd5 12. Bxd5 (12. exd5?! { This is perhaps not as good, as black gets the activity he was hoping for: } 12... Nd4! 13. c3 Nxf3+ 14. Qxf3 Kh8 { This makes the most sense from a human perspective, as black may want to continue with f7-f5 later in the future, but doesn't want to face the problems after white continues with d5-d6. } 15. b3 { This also makes sense, as in many lines, white wants to bring the bishop to this diagonal, as it will cause discomfort for black's queen. } { [%cal Gc1a3,Ga3f8] } 15...

Qf4 Qe5! { This is likely the simplest solution, as trading queens will mean that black will greatly ease the pressure on his game. } (17...

Rfe1 Bd7 21. a5 $14 { With a slight space advantage for white, and perhaps he might even continue with Re2 at some point. That being said, black has ways to defend his position as well, and white has nothing tangible yet. }) 18. Qxf7!? { This is the point. With white's queen out of play, black can force a draw with: } (18. Qxe5! { This seems like the better approach, although black can equalize following: } 18... Bxe5 19. d6 Kg7! 20. dxc7 Bxc7 21.

Kh1 Qh4! { And black forces a draw with the repetition: } 21. Kg2 (21. Qd7 h5! { The key idea. Black has just enough time for this move, and making it ensures him of a perpetual by preventing Qg4. } 22. Rg1 Rad8 { The queen cannot move, so white has to give back material: } 23. Be7! Qxe7 24. Qxe7 Rxe7 25. Rxg6 b5! $10 { When the position is likely equal following the liquidation to the opposite-colored bishop endgame. }) (21. Kh2? { This would give black a big advantage, but only with accurate play. } 21... Rf8!! { A brilliant sacrificial move. In this sequence, black not only sacrifices a piece, but a rook as well in order to get to the white king. } 22. Bxf8 (22. Qxc7 { This is the best defense, but white loses following: } 22... Rf3! { The threats of Be5 and Rxh3 are impossible to meet at once. } 23. Qg3 (23. Qd7 Be5+ 24. Kg2 Qf4! $19 { And white is mated }) 23... Rxg3 24. fxg3 Be5 $19 { And black wins }) 22... Rxf8 23.

Bxe6 Qxe6 $14 { While black doesn't have any direct threats to deal with, he does need to figure out a way to activate his dark-squared bishop, which is currently locked in due to the pawn structure. Such problems are not big problems, but they are problems nevertheless. } { [%csl Ge5,Ge4] }) 14. Qe2!? { This was white chose in a 2024 master game, which continued: } (14.

Bxe6?! { This is perhaps a bit too reactive. } (15. a5! { This is another attempt that we have not explored yet, where white does not try to defend the f5-square, but instead seizes space on the queenside, and thereby fixing the weak b7-pawn. } { [%csl Ra5,Gb7][%cal Gd5a8] } 15...

{ Ever since his arrival on the major chess scene, Danya has amazed people with his gift for handling the unknown and his ability to calculate at a level no one expected for someone so young. In this game, he puts all of his creative talents to use in a 32-move knockout. }
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. f3! { This move order is often seen as a way to transpose back into the Samisch KID. While Naroditsky keeps his options open, he is also preparing to bring about a favorable structural transformation if the opponent decides to go into a Gruenfeld. } 3... d5!? { As we will see from the rest of this game, this plan does not work so well for black. } (3... Bg7! { It feels stronger to transform the position back into a Samisch KID, which might go something like this: } 4. Nc3 O-O (4... d6 5. e4 a6 6. Be3 c6!? { This is the other way black can build up without castling, but here white should meet this with: } 7. c5!? { Schandorff calls this move a "fine positional idea," aiming to take the sting out of b7-b5. While it does accomplish that goal, the move itself is quite committal, so we should thoroughly investigate whether it stands up to current modern theory. It should be noted, however, that it scores well in the database, with 44% of all games resulting in white victories. } (7. h4!? { Immediately pressing the kingside, as it happened in the game, was also a viable option. } 7... b5 { Black starts counterplay of his own. } 8. Qd2 Nbd7 9. g4 h5 10. g5 Nh7 11. O-O-O!? $132 { With a complicated position }) 7... b5! { This seems like the best continuation, immediately putting the question to white's apparent space gain. } (7... O-O { This alternative move was covered in a 2002 master game, annotated by Schandorff. } 8. Nge2 b5!? { Once again, black goes for the main plan in this system. } 9. cxd6!? { This move was the one chosen in the game, but it feels a bit too submissive. } (9. cxb6! { This line is definitely stronger, as we'll see in many of the variations. } 9... Nbd7 10. Nf4 Nxb6 11. Be2! $14 { Allows white to develop harmoniously, without any fear of the positioning opening up against his king. That said, the b-file does provide black with some counterplay, though Stockfish indicates that the time white spends developing his pieces is more important in the long run. }) 9... exd6 10. Nf4 Nbd7?! (10... Re8! { As the theory points out, this move is the strongest. One concern with making so many pawn moves is that white has severely neglected his development, and by capturing on d6 instead of b6, he seemingly gives black an avenue to activate his pieces down the center. } 11. Qd2 b4! { Black has a strong initiative. } (11... Nbd7?! { This seems to give white the time he needs to consolidate, say after: } 12. Be2 Bb7 13. O-O Qe7 14. Bf2! $14 { With some slight space advantage for white. This move feels important to giving white an advantage in that it correctly dodges black's threat of Nd5. } { Postny, Evgeny - Tsekouras, Theodoros, 1-0, GRE-chT Div-A 38th, 2010, https://lichess.org/zTZAoFcC }) 12.

Be2 c5! $132 $146 { And black has equalized thanks to this strong pawn break, which had been previously unseen at the top level. } (14... a5?! { This move was played in the two master games played from this position, but I feel like it loses too much time. } 15. O-O! { Now white has successfully consolidated, meaning that black's pawn breaks will become much less effective. } 15... f6!? { This was the move chosen by the French FM Clement Meunier, which was met by: } (15... Bb7!? { This was the move chosen by the Polish GM Marcin Dziuba. } 16. Nd3?! { This move seems rather naive, as it is not stopping black's breaks whatsoever. } (16. Nf2! { This is the only move that keeps some advantage for white. } 16... c5! 17. dxc5 Nxe5 { Black has been able to fight his space deficit, but only at the cost of creating static weaknesses, like the pawn on d5. That can be exploited with the natural sequence: } 18. Rad1! { And suddenly, the pawn cannot be defended sufficiently. Black should choose this moment to get rid of the pawn rather than protect it with: } 18... d4! { But after } 19. Bxd4 Nbc6 20. Be3 Qxd2 21. Rxd2 $14 { White is up a pawn, and black has very little compensation for it. }) 16... c5! { Black immediately plays the breakthrough, and without having to fear pressure against his d-pawn, black has carte blanche to progress with his active intentions. } 17.

Rc1 Re6 $17 { May be even stronger for black. })) 16. exf6 Qxf6 17. Re1?! { As we will see, this move is incorrect due to a strong exchange sacrifice. } (17. Rc1! { Instead, white needed to continue down this path, making sure that he prevents black's exchange sacrifice by holding the pawn on c6 in the crosshairs, and setting up an incredible tactical idea. } 17... Nb6! { This move, which I initially considered an afterthought, turns out to be an incredibly significant move. } (17... Rxe3? { Capturing on e3 first is wrong: } 18. Qxe3 Qxd4 { Black would be normally, completely fine in such a position, were it not for the incredibly tactical blow: } 19. Nxd5!! $18 { Suddenly, white is completely winning, as neither the queen nor the pawn can capture on d5 due to the pin with Bc4, or the loss of the bishop on c8. } (19. Qxd4? Bxd4+ 20. Kh1 Nc5! { Once again, this move is strong to prevent Ne6, and this position makes for another great exercise. } 21. Bb5!! { This is the key move white needs to make to keep the game in balance. Black should now play the consolidating move: } 21... Ba6! (21... cxb5?! { This falls directly into white's plans: } 22. Ne2! $14 { And black's bishop has nowhere to go, as defending it with the knight is impossible, as Ne6 is met by Rxc8, making use of the pin along the c-file. }) 22.

The key lies in the fact that the knight protects the d5-pawn now, as seen in the sideline! Wow! } 19. Qxe3 Qxd4 { Now, the Nxd5 motif no longer works due to the Nb6. } 20. Qxd4 Bxd4+ 21. Kh1 Bd7! $10 { And black should have enough compensation for the exchange in the form of his active piece play. }) 17... Nb6?! { Meunier misses his chance. } (17... Rxe3! { This move was critical. Again, black needed to realize that the moment called for an active solution, and this exchange sacrifice certainly fits that bill. } 18.

By playing f3 in the opening and developing his queenside first, Danya lays out his intentions to continue with castling long, bringing about a sharp position with the kings castled on opposite sides. } (8.

The key difference is that black no longer can attack the pawn further with Ne8, as the rook has taken that square. }) 20. Nf4! { Fantastic accuracy from white.

Black is now losing due to the following tactical shot: } 30... Kg7 31. Rxe6! Rxe6 32. Rd7+ { 1-0 White wins. } { And black resigned as he was about to get mated. Quite simply a brilliant game from Naroditsky, who, true to his style, put the pressure on from the very first move and did not let up. As in all master games, Black had his chances as well, but under the immense pressure from Danya, he was unable to find the critical continuations when it mattered most. } 1-0

It is funny to know that he could have gone after it earlier, but white had no way of stopping it. White is now truly in deep trouble, despite having resisted in the position for longer. }) 24... f4! { Natural and strong. Naroditsky's pawns roll down the board like a tsunami wave racing to the shore, except sadly for white's king, there's no escape to higher ground, as he might've liked to say. } 25. Bh5 Ng6 26. g4 f3+ 27. Kf1 a5! { A very nice move, continuing to improve the position and opening up a second avenue towards white's king. } 28. Qd2 Ba6+ 29. Kg1 Qe6 30. Nc2 Nf4! { Good timing from Naroditsky. This piece transfer is even stronger when black can capture with the rook, due to his ability to overpower white's defense of the g4-pawn. } 31. Bxf4 Rxf4 32. Ne3 Rg8! { You have to admire how well Naroditsky converted his advantage here. Every single one of his moves since move 25 has made sense, and it is beautiful to watch how easy he makes attacking look, like a knife slicing through butter. } 33. Rh4 Qxh6 34. Qc1? { This leads to an absolutely brilliant finale. } 34... Rfxg4+! { A beautiful finishing touch. Naroditsky blasts open all the lines and, in doing so, catches all of white's pieces in a crossfire of pins and discoveries. Just like a master painter, Danya creates a masterpiece on the board, with all of white's pieces caught in lines woven together by the beautiful canvas of symmetry and intersections. } 35. Nxg4 Rxg4+ 36. Rxg4 Qxh5! { Black's bishops cut through white's kingside like a butcher's knife slicing through a filet of fish. White can defend himself by sacrificing his rook, but this will only lead to black luring white's king into the open like a hunter pulling a crab from underneath its rock. } 37. Rg3 Bxg3 38. fxg3 f2+! { And there it is. } 39. Kxf2 Qh2+ 40. Ke3 Qxg3+ { 0-1 Black wins. } { Black resigned as he saw it would be mate in a couple of moves. Kudos to Danya, who, once he found a better position, showed no mercy in driving his opponent's king to its eventual end. The game was very finely balanced, like an hourglass filled with a thousand grains of sand, but slowly, as the activity shifted, Naroditsky prevailed in the complications, proving he was — and is — truly one of one. } 0-1

{ This next game also comes to us from the 2022 US Masters. Even when behind, Naroditsky was incredibly tough to beat, and he proved it in this wild encounter with the strong Canadian FM Terry Luo. }
1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3 d5 4. Bg2 dxc4!? { Capturing right away is an interesting refinement that gives us the understanding that Naroditsky wants a sharp game. } (4... Be7 { This was the calmer approach, which leads to a more positional struggle: } 5. Nf3 O-O 6. O-O dxc4 7. Qc2 a6 8. a4 Bd7 9. Qxc4 Bc6 10. Bg5 Nbd7 11. Nc3 h6 12. Bxf6 Nxf6 13. Rad1 (13. Rfd1 Bd5 14. Nxd5 (14. Qd3! { Avoiding the exchange might even be slightly better, as this denies black the opportunity of adding another pawn to the center. White now threatens to continue with e2-e4, which should be met by: } 14... Bxf3! (14... c5?! { This was the move I had relied on for a while, but then discarded it as I felt white had great control of the long diagonal: } 15. Nxd5 Nxd5 16. dxc5!? { Perhaps even stronger is the immediate Qb3! } (16. Qb3! { Bringing the queen to b3, by contrast, is far stronger. } 16... Qc7 17. Rac1 Rac8 18. Ne5! { By playing Qb3 first, white has been able to put pressure on b7 while maintaining pressure on c5 and the long diagonal. Flexibility is often essential, and this line is a perfect example. } 18... Rfd8 19. e4! { This puts black under real pressure, where one slip can be deadly: } 19... Qb6! { This is the only move black has. As Max Illingworth states, when defending an initiative, at some point you need to make a counterthreat, or else your opponent will be able to make a threat that is too strong to defend against. } (19... Nf6?! { This move gives white the chance to seize an advantage, but only with correct play. } 20. Bh3! { This is the best move. White immediately adds pressure to both diagonals and threatens the decisive move Nxf7! } (20. a5?! { By contrast, this is the second best move, but I feel like it allows black to rearrange his pieces. } 20... Bf8 (20... Nd7?! 21. Ng6! { This is the key idea. } 21... Bg5 (21... fxg6? 22. Qxe6+ Kf8 23. e5! { The threat of Bd5 means that black must react to this. } 23... Nb8 24. d5! $18 { And white's pawns prove far too decisive. }) 22. f4 { The position is exploding, as the knight remains hanging on g6. } 22... Bf6 23. e5! c4!? 24. Qxb7 Qxa5 25. Ra1 Qb5 26. exf6 fxg6 27. fxg7 Qxb7 28. Bxb7 Rc7 29. Bf3 $16 { With a better position for white. }) 21. Bh3 { Now white finds the main idea, but the difference here is that black can protect the pawn in a second way: } 21... Re8! $14 { This is the key idea to spot. White is a bit better, but now it is much more challenging to make progress. }) 20... Qd6 { This move is best, as it protects the tender point at e6. } (20... Rxd4!? { This exchange sacrifice also warranted some merit. } 21. Rxd4 Qxe5 22. Rd2 Rc7 (22... Qxe4? 23. Bg2! $18 { And black is in big trouble }) 23. Bg2! { White threatens to continue with f2-f4, so black needs to prevent. } 23... g5 24. a5 Kf8 25. Qe3! $16 { White maintains a clear advantage, and wants to continue with f2-f4 next. }) 21. Nc4!? { This is one of two possible choices. } (21. Ng6! { This move might even be stronger. } 21... Kh7 22. Nxe7 Qxe7 23. e5! (23. d5!? Nxe4 24. Qe3 f5 25. f3 Nd6 26. dxe6 $16) 23...

Nb6 Rc7 { Here, once again white has an advantage, but the key move to realize it is: } 23. d5! c4 24. Qf3 exd5 { And now, the nice sequence: } 25. e5! { You see this theme quite a lot in the Catalan, where white pushes a pawn, only to move past and not recapture. } 25... Bc5 26. Nxd5 Nxd5 27. Rxd5 b5!? { Black secures his queenside, but now white can hit him right down the middle: } 28. axb5 axb5 29. e6! fxe6 30. Bxe6+ Kh8 31. Rcd1! $14) 22... b5!? 23. Ne3 c4 24.

Qf3! { Avoiding the trade is correct. } (20. Qxb6!? { This releases quite a bit of the tension. } 20... Nxb6 21. a5 Nd7 22. Nxd7 Rxd7 23. d5! Rcd8! $14 { White is a bit better, although it is hard to make progress given how well black's rooks are placed. }) 20... Nf6 21. Nc4! { This is the best continuation, although there were myriad options in this rich position. } (21. Nxf7!? { This was another interesting continuation } 21... Kxf7 22. e5 cxd4 23. exf6 Bxf6 $10 { Despite the flurry of tactics, it doesn't seem like white has come out with much in this middlegame featuring opposite-colored bishops. }) 21... Qb4 22. d5 exd5 23. exd5 { At this point, black needs to blockade the pawn: } 23... Ne8! { A beneficial regrouping move, as the knight will act as a stopgap in front of the d5-pawn. } 24. h4 Nd6 25. b3 $14 { With a long lasting advantage, as white is controlling the game with his slightly more active pieces. }) 16... Bxc5 17. Qb3 { Black's position is starting to feel quite a bit of pressure, and now he must be quite accurate. } (17. Ne5!? { This is another try white has, in order to put immediate pressure along the diagonal. } 17... Qf6! { This move is crucial, when after: } 18. Ng4 Qg5 19. Bxd5 exd5 20. Qxd5 Qxg4 21. Qxc5 Qxe2 $10 { And black has pretty much equalized. }) 17... Qc7! { This is the best way to get out of the pin, and after: } 18. Rac1 Rac8 19. e3 Rfd8 20. Nd2 $14 { White has nagging pressure thanks to the power of his light-squared bishop. }) 15. Bxf3 c6 16. e3 { White seems to have a space advantage, but it is not so easy to exploit, especially after: } 16... Qc7! { We'll see why this move comes in handy. } 17. h4 g6 18. Qc2 h5 19. e4 e5! $10 { When black has gotten his main break. }) 14... exd5 15. Qb3 Rb8 16. Ne5 c6 $10) 13... Bd5 14. Nxd5 exd5 15. Qb3 Rb8 16. Ne5! $10 $132 { With an equal position, although perhaps white has some pull. }) 5. Nf3 c6 6. Ne5 Bb4+! { A very nice inclusion. By forcing white's bishop to block the check, the d-pawn will be undefended, forcing white to take a tempo defending it. } 7. Bd2 Be7 8. e3 b5! { Forcing white to take a complicated route to winning back his pawn. } (8... O-O!? { No doubt Naroditsky considered this move as well, but it feels like it gives white everything he wants: } 9. Nxc4 c5!? (9... b6 10.

One way this position could continue is: } 12. O-O e5! { This move is typical in these types of positions. Black opens up lines for his bishop like an archer readying his bow to hit the bullseye. Now, the threat of Bh3 is quite strong, again all because white lacks his light-squared bishop. } 13. f3 { A reasonable attempt to close the lines. } (13. dxe5!?

Qb2 $10 { But the position is dynamically still equal, as even though white has two minors for the rook, the queen and rook are well coordinated, and black's queen in particular stands on a fantastic square, where it sees the entire board. }) 15... Nd7 16. f4 { White has solidified his protection of his e5-pawn. The game continue: } 16... O-O 17.

Being down a pawn, black needs to put up real resistance to white's attempts to activate his queenside. } 19.

Bc1 Nc5 22. Nd2 Rd8! $10 { And despite being down two pawns, black's activity and far-advanced passed pawn gives him equality. }) 19... Nb6 20.

Ra2 Nc4! $10 { With a clamp on white's position }) 15. Nc3! { Unfortunately for White, he has no option but to return the exchange. } (15. Re1? { Trying to hold onto the material is wrong as black's activity is simply too strong: } 15... O-O 16. Nc3 b4! 17.

Kg2 Bxd4 20. exd4 Nd3! $10 { And again, black has great activity thanks to his powerfully placed knight on d3.

It doesn't seem like that is the case, as with Black's rook on b8, Black always had the option of continuing with Ba8, which, in fact, is what happened in the game. } 15.

Bh3 Bxa6! { This is the issue: Black was able to reveal an attack on white's queen now and, having gotten rid of the pawn, has been able to eliminate a real thorn in its side. Danya is fighting back, showing real grit in the comeback effort. } 31. Qa1 Bb5 { Here comes the crucial moment. Having consolidated his position to a certain extent, Naroditsky prepares himself for a massive defensive effort, until his opponent, who might have already gotten excited like a kid on Christmas, grabs the "free" pawn. } 32.

Again, under pressure, Naroditsky thrived unlike anyone else. } (36. Bd1!! { Wildly, this was the only move to hold the game, and under time pressure, it would have been challenging to spot this.

This was a resilient effort by Naroditsky, whose persistence was highlighted after getting behind on move 18, but he fought his way back to win.

{ This next game comes from one of Danya's final OTB tournaments- In December of 2024, he participated in the 2024 World Rapid and Blitz Championships in New York City. While no one knew it at the time, he would leave us with one final beautiful performance to show just how incredible a player he was —a reminder of how we should cherish the performances of players today, as they might not be here tomorrow. }
1. e4 e5 { Naroditsky was known as an expert in the Ruy Lopez, so I wanted to add one of his very best games from the black perspective. } 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 g6!? { This is an interesting twist that I've looked into a lot myself, to fianchetto the bishop, and making it harder for white to continue with his plan of d2-d4. White often gets in this plan anyway, but one could argue that opening the position will later favor black with his powerful bishop duo. } 4. c3 a6 5. Ba4 Bg7 6. O-O Nge7!? { Naroditsky opts to develop the knight straight away. Also possible was: } (6... d6!? 7. d4 Bd7 8. d5 Nce7 9. Bxd7+ Qxd7 10. c4 h6 11. Nc3 f5 { Both sides are developing quite naturally, as black has been able to get in his main pawn break. As far as the game is concerned, there are a few main ways in which white can meet black's kingside play. } 12. Ne1!? { This is one way, with the idea of playing f2-f3 next to support the e4-pawn. Central pawns are like the foundations for a house- They must have strong protection in order for us to coordinate our pieces around them. } 12... Nf6 13. f3 { The natural continuation. } 13... O-O!? { Here is an interesting moment I want to take a look at. Black has gotten in his main kingside break in these positions, which is excellent, but it has come at a cost- What cost? The problem for black is that because he allowed an exchange of light-squared bishops, he gives white the advantage of having the superior minor piece, as all of his pawns are on the opposite color of his bishop. What is black's argument, then? What black is trying to say is that while white has the long-term advantage of the better minor pieces, he is willing to sacrifice short-term piece placement for speed, in that he is faster at creating kingside counterplay than white is at creating play on the queenside. This balance of static and dynamic factors is essential to understanding in many high-level chess encounters. } { [%csl Rc1,Yg7][%cal Gf5f4,Gg6g5,Gg5g4,Gb2b4,Gc4c5] } 14. Nd3 { If we consider the dialogue above, we understand now why white continued in this way. His knight is well-placed to support the c4-c5 break. } 14... c5!? { This is a rather direct approach, trying to prevent white's break by stopping it immediately. } (14... g5!? { This is another idea, with the idea of gradually building up pressure on the f-file with Rf7 before capturing on e4. } 15. exf5 Qxf5! { This makes sense, as black wants to prevent the move Ne4. } 16. Nf2 { White prepares the maneuver to e4 once more, but now having traded off the e-pawns, black can start to undermine white's center: } 16... b5! { This is the key idea that many players playing with the black pieces have found here. } 17. Qe2 (17. b3 e4! { This is an excellent move. While white has tried to support his center, he's left the diagonal open, and black exploits it with a strong central pawn sacrifice. } 18. fxe4? { Capturing is incorrect as it allows black to open up all the lines favorably. } (18. Ncxe4! Nfxd5 19. Rb1 Nf4 20. Bxf4 Qxf4 $10 { Keeps the equality }) 18... Nxe4! 19. Ncxe4 Bxa1 20. Bxg5!? { White gains a pawn back, although after: } 20... hxg5 21. Qxa1 Ng6! $17 { And black would have maintained the advantage } (21... Rf7? { As it happened in the game, black immediately slipped up, giving white a route back into the game. } 22. Ng3? (22. Re1! { Black likely wanted to double the rooks on the f-file, but now it is not so effective: } 22... Raf8 23. h3 Ng6 { Black is trying to impove his pieces, but after: } 24. Ng4! $14 { White has managed to stabilize his position despite being down in material. One key detail is that if a black rook comes to the e-file, that would be met with Nf6+ }) 22... Qc2? $10 { Istratescu, A. - Ciolacu, Alessia-Mihaela, 1/2-1/2, GP Stage 5 Braila 2022, https://lichess.org/83dYH7dD } (22...

Rf7 17. Be3 Raf8 18. Qa4?! { But this is a bit of an inaccuracy. } (18. Nf2! { It was far better to deal with the pressure on e4 at once. } 18... fxe4 19. Ncxe4! { This is the correct way to capture on e4. } (19. Nfxe4?! Nf5! 20. Bf2 Nd4 $14 { Gives black counterplay with his knight well-placed on d4, even if his bishop is quite sad. }) 19... Nf5 20. Bd2 Nd4 21. Ng3! $16 { A nice move- avoiding the exchange is an important idea to keep in mind when ahead in space }) 18... Qc8?! { Perhaps not the best continuation } (18... Qxa4! { It was better to exchange queens. If we take solely the static factors into account, we might question this decision as generally endgames favor white in this case, as black must find some way to create threats on the kingside, however, initial looks are decieving: } 19. Rxa4 g4! { This is the issue- Black immediately strikes at white's kingside before white has a chance to meet it. } 20. Raa1 gxf3 21. gxf3 fxe4 22. Nxe4 { And here, black has a intense tactical continuation: } 22... Nfxd5! 23. cxd5 Rxf3! $10 { With dynamic equality }) 19. b4?! { Again, white is ignoring black's kingside ideas at his own peril. } (19. Bd2! { It feels better to retreat the bishop, as now white can react better to black's kingside plans: } 19... g4 20. Qd1 gxf3 21. Qxf3 fxe4 22. Nxe4 Nfxd5 23. Qxf7+! Rxf7 24. Rxf7 { The rook is now taboo due to the fork on d6, and after: } 24... Qe6 25. Rxg7+! Kxg7 26. cxd5 Nxd5 27. Ndf2 $14 { White has good piece play in this wild material imbalance. }) 19... f4?! (19... g4! $10 { As we know, black really needed to play this break. }) 20. Bd2 $14 { And white had an advantage thanks to his queenside play. } { Van Delft, Merijn - Ernst, Sipke, 1/2-1/2, Dieren op, 2008, https://lichess.org/VzmYcMrc }) 16. Re1 b6 17. Ra3 g5 { Black begins to inch his way forward. } 18. Nf2 f4 19. Rb3 Rab8 20. Nb5 Ng6 21. Kf1!? { It is interesting to see that one of white's strategies involves running away with the king. This is a typical idea in such closed struggles. } 21... h5 22. Ke2! g4 23. Rg1 Nh4 24. Kd2 $14) 7. d4 exd4 8. cxd4 b5! { This seems like the best way to continue developing- In fact, breaking in the center at once can put black in quite a bit of trouble. } (8... d5!? { This was the alternative, preventing white's expansion directly. } 9. exd5 Nxd5 10. Re1+ (10. Bg5!? { This was another continuation that many players playing the white pieces have used. } 10... Qd6! (10... f6?! { Here, castling by hand does not work as well: } 11. Re1+ Kf7 12. Bxc6 bxc6 { And here, there is the nice continuation: } 13. Ne5+! Kg8 14. Nc3 $16 { With a definite advantage as white has the better pawn structure, development, and king safety. What more could you ask for? }) 11. Nbd2! { And black's queen is going to get harassed. } 11... O-O 12. Nc4! Qb4 13. Rc1 $16 { Oleksienko, M. - Mazur, Ste, 1-0, TCh-SVK 2016-17, 2017, https://lichess.org/aVj6gOqK } { And again, white has the advantage. }) 10... Be6 { At first, it would feel like white has a bit of an initiative, and indeed he does have a bit of activity, although it isn't exactly one you would consider to be of lasting character: } 11. Bg5 Qd7 12. Nc3 O-O 13. Ne5! { White needs to keep this up to maintain the advantage. } 13... Bxe5!? { As counterintuitive as it may seem, capturing on e5 is the best way to proceed, even though it weakens the dark squares around black's king. } (13... Qd6?! { This is not as good: } 14. Ne4! Qb4 15. Bxc6 bxc6 16. b3 $14 { And white's knights will occupy great positions following Nc5. }) 14. dxe5 Nxc3! { And here, it is absolutely critical to trade knights, as white wanted to continue with Ne4-f6 next. } 15. bxc3 b5! { Again, black cannot waste time. He realizes that if white is given one moment to move around, he will start a massive fire against the black king. } (15... Qxd1!? 16. Bxd1! $14 { This is the best capture, as it both dodges the move b7-b5 and sets up the move Bf3 next. }) 16. Qxd7 Bxd7 17. Bc2 $14 { Even though black has put up his best resistance to avoid it, white remains on top in this endgame position with control of the dark squares and the bishop pair. }) 9. Bb3 (9. Bc2! { This might even be a tad better in that white's bishop avoids getting attacked with Nc6-a5, although black can continue with: } 9... d5! 10. exd5 Nb4! { This is the difference —Having already played b7-b5 to break the pin, black can now capture the knight with Nb4, thereby avoiding opening up his king along the e-file. } 11.

While concrete calculations and the initiative once marked it, this shift from open to structural means that a great deal of this phase will focus on the maneuvering aspects and piece placement. } 13...

Qh3? { Although this defends the bishop, it allows White's Rb4 to enter the game with a powerful effect. This situation encapsulates the challenges that come with defending a worse position- White was asking all the questions, and black had to find the correct answers to avoid falling into a losing position. } 39. Rf4! $18 { White now is completely winning as all of his pieces are coming into the game. The Bf6 can no longer move as it would allow Re1-e7, which would completely overwhelm black's position. } 39... Rc8 40.

Kg8 42. b3 Kh8 { Sadly for black, all he can do is shuffle back and forth, as all of his pieces are completely tied down. } 43. a4! $18 { And the creation of an outside passed pawn spells black's doom. }) 41. f3 Bxb2 42. Qf2 Bg7 43. Rf7! { White's rook invades. The rest is easy, assuming you have the technique just like Danya. } 43... Rg8 44. Ree7 Qh6 45. d7! { This signifies the end. With all of the pressure on the 7th rank, a second idea of promotion is the last thing black needs. } 45... Qd6 46. Rxg7 Qd1+ 47. Kg2 Bxf3+ 48. Qxf3 Qd2+ 49. Re2 $18 { 1-0 White wins. } { Manakova resigned as she saw she could no longer prolong the struggle. This was a magnificent technical effort from Naroditsky, who made an interesting, yet perhaps flawed, decision on the 18th move that resulted in an imbalanced game where White had an enduring initiative against Black's king. Despite having the two bishops and the possibility to consolidate, black didn't manage to do so, and Danya showed no mercy in his final execution. } 1-0

{ As you may have figured out, Danya thrived in the chaos. This was certainly the case in this game, as Aravindh found out. As you play through this game, please pay close attention to the balance between the abstract and concrete factors in this battle, and how they interact with one another to produce one of the more fascinating encounters in recent memory. }

Who would walk their king down the runway of shame to the dead center of the board where it can get marrauded by white's pieces?

Perhaps Aravindh did not want to give up control of the e5-square, but it seems insignificant in relations to other aspects of play given how dynamic the situation is. } 19...
