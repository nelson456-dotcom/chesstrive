FIX FOR "useRef is not defined" ERROR
===============================================

The import has been added correctly to the file:
  Line 1: import React, { useState, useEffect, useCallback, useRef } from 'react';

However, the browser is using a cached hot-reload file.

TO FIX:
-------

1. In your terminal where the frontend dev server is running:
   - Press Ctrl+C to stop the server

2. Restart the dev server:
   cd chessrep-main/frontend
   npm start

3. In your browser:
   - Hard refresh the page: Ctrl+Shift+R (or Ctrl+F5)
   - Or clear browser cache and reload

This will force the browser to load the updated file with the useRef import.

===============================================
VERIFICATION
===============================================

After restarting, you should see:
✅ No "useRef is not defined" errors
✅ Real-time sync working correctly
✅ Collaboration section visible

The file has been correctly updated - this is just a browser cache issue.
